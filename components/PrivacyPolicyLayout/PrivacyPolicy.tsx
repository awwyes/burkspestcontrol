        We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify
        your computer and browser) and other automated tools such as tracking
        pixels to improve the experience of the site and Services, such as
        saving your preferences from visit to visit to present you with a
        customized version of the Website. Many web browsers are initially set
        up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all
        cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Instructions for how
        to manage cookies in popular browsers are available at: Internet
        Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari (iOS), Safari (Mac), and Opera.
        However, certain features of our Sites may not work if you delete or
        disable cookies. We use the following types of cookies: Session Cookies:
        Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from
        page to page within our Sites and are typically deleted once you close
        your browser. Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies reside on your
        system and allow us to customize your experience if you leave and later
        return to our Sites. For example, persistent cookies may allow us to
        remember your preferences. Advertising Cookies: Advertising cookies are
        used to learn more about you and advertise products/services that might
        interest you. Analytics Cookies: Analytics cookies help us understand
        how our Sites are working and who is visiting our Sites. Google
        Analytics is one tool we use, and you can learn more by reviewing
        Google’s Privacy Policy. We employ software technology that enables us
        to track certain aspects of a user’s visit to our Sites. This technology
        helps us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content
        is effective, how consumers engage with our Sites, and how consumers
        arrive at and/or depart from our Sites. The software typically uses two
        methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear
        gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded
        in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are
        viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear
        gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web
        pages and email messages that track whether a user views a web page or
        email message. User activity information may be associated with
        additional information about a user’s session and Personal Information,
        if provided by the user. If you arrive at our Sites by “clicking
        through” from another website, then certain information about you that
        you provided to that other website, such as the terms you searched that
        led you to our Sites, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You
        should review the Privacy Policy of any website from which you reached
        our Sites to determine what information the operator collects and how it
        uses such information. We may retain information about you provided to
        us by other websites and will use it in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or
        Personal Information.

        collect and use information about your use of our Sites or Services as

        other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information.
        We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected
        by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our
        Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Advertiser
        may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via our Sites or on
        third-party websites. If you do not want to receive interest-based
        advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
        Consumer Choice Page. The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or
        more interest-based advertising networks. Opt-outs are device and
        browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out
        preferences for each device and browser. Deleting browser cookies can
        remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers browser
        extensions that help preserve the opt-out preferences you set on the
        DAA’s Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to
        interest-based advertising. You may still receive other types of online
        advertising.
