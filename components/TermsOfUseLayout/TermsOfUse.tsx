        Dispute Resolution & Arbitration
      </Heading>

        Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these
        Terms, the Site,, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of
        state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties shall be
        solely and exclusively resolved according to binding arbitration as set
        forth in this section; however, disputes regarding the scope and
        enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by a
        court, not an arbitrator. Also, individual small claims actions are not
        subject to this arbitration provision so long as they remain in small
        claims court. For purposes of this section, “we,” “us,” and “our” refer
        to Burks Pest Control and its Affiliates. Unless you and we agree
        otherwise, the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by the
        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration
        Rules, if applicable, otherwise under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
        These rules are found at www.adr.com. If the AAA cannot serve and you
        and we cannot agree on a substitute, a court with proper jurisdiction
        will select the arbitrator. The arbitrator will follow the applicable
        substantive law, including applying the Terms, and will apply the same
        statutes of limitation and privileges that a court would apply. The
        arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or remedies that would
        apply under applicable law to an individual action brought in court,
        including, without limitation, punitive damages (which will be governed
        by Constitutional standards employed by the courts) and injunctive,
        equitable, and declaratory relief (but only in favor of the individual
        party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by the party’s individual claim). The arbitrator will have
        authority to award fees and costs of attorneys, witnesses, and experts
        to the extent permitted by the Terms, the arbitration administrator’s
        rules, or applicable law. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will
        take place at a location reasonably convenient to your residence. IF A
        CLAIM IS ARBITRATED, YOU AND WE WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY
        TRIAL. YOU AND WE ALSO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,
        PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT
        OR IN ARBITRATION, EITHER AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER, OR
        TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS WITH CLAIMS OF ANY OTHER PERSONS (THE
        “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT
        ANY ARBITRATION IN VIOLATION OF THIS PROVISION OR TO ISSUE ANY RELIEF
        THAT APPLIES TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OTHER THAN TO YOU AND/OR US
        INDIVIDUALLY. The AAA charges fees to administer an arbitration
        proceeding and the arbitrator also charges fees. These arbitration costs
        will be paid by you and us in accordance with the applicable arbitration
        rules. We will always pay any fees or expenses that we are required to
        pay by law and the arbitration administrator’s rules or that we are
        required to pay for this arbitration provision to be enforced. Either
        you or we may request a panel of three (3) arbitrators, but in the
        absence of both parties’ agreement, the requesting party will be
        responsible for the cost of the additional arbitrators. Either you or we
        may request at any time prior to the hearing that the award be
        accompanied by a reasoned opinion. The award rendered by the
        arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on all parties, except that a
        party may within thirty (30) days of the original award request an
        appeal tribunal, constituted in the same number and by the same process
        as the initial arbitrator(s). The appealing party will be responsible
        for the filing fee and other arbitration fees and costs subject to award
        by the appeal tribunal under applicable law. The appeal tribunal will
        review all questions or law and fact under a clearly erroneous standard.
        The award of the appeal tribunal will be final and binding, except for
        any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Judgment may
        be entered on the award in any court having jurisdiction thereof. No
        arbitration award involving the parties will have any preclusive effect
        as to issues or claims in any dispute involving anyone who is not a
        party to the arbitration, nor will an arbitration award in prior
        disputes involving other parties have preclusive effect in an
        arbitration between the parties to this arbitration provision. This
        arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving
        interstate commerce and will be governed by the FAA. Before having
        recourse to arbitration, you and we agree to try in good faith to settle
        any controversy or claim by at least four (4) hours of mediation
        administered under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules with us agreeing
        to pay the costs of the mediation. This arbitration provision will
        survive the expiration or termination of the Terms. In the event of a
        conflict or inconsistency between this arbitration provision, on the one
        hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or other provisions of the
        Terms, on the other hand, this arbitration provision will govern. If any
        portion of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or
        unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this
        arbitration provision, except that (i) if the class action waiver is
        limited, voided, or found unenforceable, then this arbitration provision
        (except for this sentence) will be null and void with respect to such
        proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or
        invalidation of the class action waiver; and (ii) if a claim is brought
        seeking public injunctive relief on behalf of third parties and a court
        determines that the restrictions in the class action waiver or elsewhere
        in this arbitration provision prohibiting the arbitrator from awarding
        relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such
        claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been
        exhausted), the claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in
        court and any individual claims seeking monetary relief will be
        arbitrated. In such a case the parties will request that the court stay
        the claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award
        pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court. In no event
        will a claim for public injunctive relief or a class action be
        arbitrated. Any matters submitted to a court for resolution shall be
        submitted to the state or federal courts of Decatur or Morgan County,
        Alabama and all parties agree to the personal jurisdiction thereof.
